# Dinner Planning App

This app is written in vanilla Javascript with Boostrap 5 and the Day.js library to make dates easier to work with. It was done as a learning project for vanilla Javascript. Please critique it.

It uses jsonstorage.net to store and retrieve json data for meals and leftovers. The API key here only accesses some throwaway data and will be revoked at some point. I've only included it so that a coulple of people can review my code.
